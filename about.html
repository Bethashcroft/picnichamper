        Inspired by lockdown state sanctioned daily walks, which turned into
        long meandering strolls centered around a picnic with (socially
        distanced) friends, Picnic Hamper Bolton wants to take the fiddly bit
        out of your day out.

        We currently have two delicious bespoke menu options, with something to
        suit every taste. Our emphasis is on keeping the great outdoors as green
        as possible, so our treats (and every single one of their ingredients)
        is picked up as locally as possible, then carefully wrapped in minimal
        packaging, and presented in an easily transported but most importantly
        returnable picnic hamper backpack which we then clean and reuse.
